	<p>Hi, I am Sarah! I am originally from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-36dQ_gIEA">Brunei</a> (a tiny country located on the island of Borneo) but grew up in Melbourne, Australia. I am currently working in NYC as a Digital Marketer and freelance Creative Professional.</p>


	<p>In addition to my interest in all things Digital, I have a deep-seated curiosity for understanding people. I work full-time in Digital Marketing but I have a background in branding, psychology and sociology. I graduated with my Masters of Integrated Marketing at NYU where I majored in Brand Management and I hold my Bachelors degree in Sociology from the University of Melbourne, Australia. I have internship and work experience at advertising agencies and media companies such as Disney ABC Television Group and Viacom Media Networks in the roles of Integrated Marketing, Edtitorial and Creative Production.</p>


	<p>Beyond my 9 to 5 job, I'm passionate about photography, videography, music and artistic expression. I am currently working towards my goal of becoming a Digital Marketing, Branding and Creative Consultant. </p>
